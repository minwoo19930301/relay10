# Relay10

> Route explicitly. Keep handoffs inspectable. Separate correctness signals
> from report clarity.

Relay10 is a small Codex harness with zero third-party npm runtime
dependencies. It maps the local Codex model catalog into three capability
labels, records stage handoffs as files, keeps command and reviewer results
separate from report-clarity checks, and renders a standalone HTML run report.

This is an early `0.1.0` release candidate. The `frontier`, `balanced`, and
`economy` labels come from catalog metadata and user overrides. They are not
live price measurements, benchmarks, or guarantees that Relay10 selected the
cheapest, weakest, or strongest available model.

## What it does

- **Deterministic initial routing:** five task dimensions select stage profiles
  before a run starts. Version 0.1 does not automatically escalate a failed
  stage to another model.
- **Small execution surface:** one Node CLI, built-in Node modules, and the
  installed Codex CLI.
- **Inspectable handoffs:** each completed stage has a declared role, effort,
  sandbox, output path, and event record.
- **Separate signals:** explicitly configured commands, a model reviewer, and
  Reader-10 results are shown separately instead of being presented as one
  proof of correctness.
- **Two Reader-10 modes:** the default deterministic mode checks document
  structure and accessibility heuristics. Live mode makes ten reader-model
  invocations per round; neither mode establishes factual correctness.

## Quick start

Requirements: Node 20+ and an authenticated Codex CLI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minwoo19930301/relay10.git
cd relay10
npm link

r10 doctor
r10 init
r10 route "research the API and build a small CLI"
r10 run "research the API and build a small CLI" --dry-run
r10 run "research the API and build a small CLI"
```

To request live Reader-10, which schedules ten separate reader invocations per
round:

```bash
r10 run "your task" --live-readers --budget-calls 30
```

Different reader roles may use the same model or models from the same family;
ten invocations do not guarantee ten independent judgments. The invocation
budget counts Relay10's Codex subprocess launches, not provider-internal model
turns, tokens, or currency cost.

The report is written under `.relay10/runs/<run-id>/report.html`.

## Default pipeline

| Stage | Capability label | Effort | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| scout | economy | low | read-only + optional search | inspect sources and collect context |
| architect | frontier | max | read-only | produce a plan |
| maker | balanced | medium | workspace-write | implement the plan |
| verification | no model | n/a | explicit argv commands | record opt-in command results |
| reviewer | frontier | high | read-only | review correctness and risk |
| explainer | balanced | low | read-only | write a newcomer-facing summary |
| Reader-10 | rules or configured model | low | read-only | check report structure or model-reported clarity |

These are role defaults, not a claim that one role always receives the
objectively best or cheapest model. The available catalog metadata and local
overrides determine the concrete model and supported effort.

## Commands

```text
r10 init [--force]
r10 doctor
r10 route <task> [--json]
r10 run <task> [--dry-run] [--live-readers] [--budget-calls N]
r10 inspect [run-id] [--json]
r10 report [run-id] [--output file]
r10 replay [run-id] --frozen [--output file]
```

In 0.1, `replay --frozen` verifies the recorded hashes and either reports the
saved `report.html` path or copies that exact file outside the run directory.
`report` is the separate model-free re-render command and writes a new file. A
frozen replay is not a full environment snapshot, resume facility, or proof
that remote model behavior can be reproduced.

## Configuration

`r10 init` writes `relay10.config.json`. Model roles are derived from
`codex debug models`; explicit model overrides take precedence. See the
[example configuration](https://github.com/minwoo19930301/relay10/blob/main/examples/relay10.config.json)
and [configuration schema](https://github.com/minwoo19930301/relay10/blob/main/schema/config.schema.json).

Verification commands are intentionally opt-in because project commands can
have side effects. They use an executable plus literal argv array, not a shell
command string:

```json
{
  "verification": {
    "commands": [
      { "command": "npm", "args": ["test"] },
      { "command": "npm", "args": ["run", "build"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

The default configuration runs no verification command. Configure commands
that are appropriate and safe for the current repository.

Live Reader-10 can use the discovered economy-labelled model or supplied model
slugs:

```json
{
  "readerGate": {
    "mode": "live",
    "models": ["small-model-a", "small-model-b"],
    "minPass": 9,
    "maxRounds": 2,
    "concurrency": 3
  }
}
```

## Version 0.1 limits

- The scout is a general read/search Codex stage, not a dedicated crawler,
  browser automation system, or site-specific extraction engine.
- Deterministic Reader-10 checks structure, length, terminology, links, and
  accessibility signals. It does not semantically understand the report.
- Live Reader-10 uses ten model invocations per round. Model names do not imply
  independent errors, and live readers check clarity rather than truth.
- There is no resume/checkpoint engine, `/goal` DSL, long-running scheduler, or
  durable workflow database.
- Runtime model routing uses catalog descriptions, priority, supported efforts,
  and overrides; it does not query live prices or benchmark model quality.
- Verification commands are explicit opt-in configuration. No project command
  is inferred or run by default.
- Saved artifacts support inspection and model-free report regeneration, but
  they are not a complete frozen ledger of the machine, tools, or model service.
