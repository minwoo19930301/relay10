# DisciplinedRun

> A lightweight execution discipline for coding agents.
> Explicit scope. Risk-aware effort. Inspectable evidence. Separate verdicts.

**DisciplinedRun** is a lightweight agent-run harness (formerly **Relay10**)
with zero third-party npm runtime dependencies. It combines a portable
eight-skill workflow pack with an optional CLI pipeline. The pack loads on
**Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build**. The CLI maps a local model catalog into
`frontier` / `balanced` / `economy` labels, records stage handoffs as files,
keeps command and reviewer results separate from report-clarity checks, and
renders a standalone HTML run report.

The **Effort Governor** is one subsystem, not the whole product. Five task
dimensions assess a run, tune maker and reviewer effort, help decide whether
frontier advice is needed, and honor `--budget-calls` as a hard ceiling on
pipeline stage launches—not tokens or currency.

This branch prepares the `0.2.0` product-name release. The latest immutable
published release remains `v0.1.1` under the Relay10 name until a new release
is explicitly approved. The `frontier`, `balanced`, and `economy` labels come
from catalog metadata and user overrides. They are not live price
measurements, benchmarks, or guarantees that DisciplinedRun selected the
cheapest, weakest, or strongest available model.

Short CLI: **`dpr`** (Disciplined Process Run). Legacy aliases: `r10` /
`relay10`. Config
`relay10.config.json`, run dir `.relay10/`, skill ids `relay10-*`, and the
GitHub repo path `minwoo19930301/relay10` still work in this release.

## What it does

- **Effort Governor:** five task dimensions select stage profiles, then
  scout evidence decides whether an economy task needs the frontier architect.
  Version 0.2 still does not escalate after a failed stage.
- **Host-first skills:** repo skills for Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build,
  plus one Node CLI on builtins only.
- **Inspectable handoffs:** each completed stage has a declared role, effort,
  sandbox, output path, and event record.
- **Separate signals:** explicitly configured commands, a model reviewer, and
  Reader-10 results are shown separately instead of being presented as one
  proof of correctness.
- **Two Reader-10 modes:** the default deterministic mode checks document
  structure and accessibility heuristics. Live mode makes ten reader-model
  invocations per round; neither mode establishes factual correctness.

## Quick start

**Skill hosts (Codex, Claude Code, Grok Build):** clone the repo (or install
the Claude marketplace plugin). Skills appear via `.agents/skills` /
`.claude/skills`. No separate Codex install is required just to load skills.

**Optional controlled CLI pipeline:** Node 20+ and, for live
`disciplinedrun run` model stages, an authenticated Codex CLI on `PATH`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minwoo19930301/relay10.git
cd relay10
npm link

# product CLI (short: dpr · legacy: r10, relay10)
dpr doctor
dpr init
dpr route "research the API and build a small CLI"
dpr run "research the API and build a small CLI" --dry-run
dpr run "research the API and build a small CLI"
```

To request live Reader-10, which schedules ten separate reader invocations per
round:

```bash
dpr run "your task" --live-readers --budget-calls 30
```

Different reader roles may use the same model or models from the same family;
ten invocations do not guarantee ten independent judgments. The invocation
budget counts DisciplinedRun pipeline stage launches (Codex subprocesses in
0.2), not provider-internal model turns, tokens, or currency cost.

The report is written under `.relay10/runs/<run-id>/report.html`.

## Current provider and app support

The DisciplinedRun 0.2.0 preview is **host-first**. The skill pack runs on the
coding agent you already use. The optional CLI pipeline is a separate
controlled-run surface.

| Target | Current status | What that means |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code as a Skill and Plugin host | Preview; host path verified 2026-07-15, renamed manifests statically validated 2026-07-17 | Marketplace / `.claude/skills` load all eight skills. This is Skill-host guidance, not native stage execution. |
| Grok Build / Grok CLI as a Skill host | Preview, verified 2026-07-15 | `.agents/skills` loads the same pack. This is Skill-host guidance, not xAI stage execution. Note: Grok Build's account-level "Coding data sharing" setting defaults to opt-in (xAI may retain and train on coding session data); DisciplinedRun never launches Grok and cannot see that setting — check it in your own Grok session. |
| Codex as a Skill host | Repository surface, statically validated | Same pack via `.agents/skills` / plugin layout. |
| Codex CLI as optional `disciplinedrun run` stage runtime | Supported and tested | Live model stages still launch `codex exec` and discover models via `codex debug models` in 0.2. Skill-host use does not require this. |
| Codex with an xAI/Grok custom provider as a **stage executor** | Experimental candidate, untested | Not the same as Grok skill-host support. |
| Anthropic/Claude or Google Gemini APIs as CLI stage executors | Unsupported in 0.2 | Skill-host support for Claude Code is separate and already works. |
| Mixed providers in one CLI run | Unsupported | Stage config holds a model, not a provider switch. |
| Codex desktop app or IDE | Indirect shell use only | Can invoke `dpr` / `disciplinedrun` / `r10`; no native progress UI. |
| ChatGPT app/web or a standalone GUI | Not implemented | Needs MCP/Apps SDK or a local sidecar. |

Skills guide the host agent; they do not silently replace that host’s model for
every tool call. Evidence for host checks lives in
[host-surface-verification.md](https://github.com/minwoo19930301/relay10/blob/main/docs/host-surface-verification.md).

## Skill pack

DisciplinedRun distills recurring patterns from current global coding agents and
Agent Skill collections into eight on-demand skills instead of installing a
large catalog. Skill **ids remain `relay10-*`** in this release for host
compatibility:

| Skill | Job | Important boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `relay10-orchestrate` | choose the smallest useful workflow | does not switch the host agent's current task model |
| `relay10-research` | collect current read-only evidence | does not mutate a repository |
| `relay10-spec` | define outcome, non-goals, acceptance, and rollback | does not implement plan-only requests |
| `relay10-build` | implement an authorized change in small slices | does not publish |
| `relay10-debug` | reproduce and isolate root cause | diagnosis alone does not authorize repair |
| `relay10-review` | review a fixed baseline and report findings | remains read-only |
| `relay10-release` | prove package, artifact, hash, and support claims | requires explicit publication authority |
| `relay10-skill-lab` | tune triggers and compare against no-skill baseline | rejects skills without measured benefit |

The Confirmed Task Contract is an optional output of the `relay10-spec` Skill.
`disciplinedrun run` does not automatically ingest, cryptographically bind, or
enforce that contract. The same boundary applies to other Skill guidance: a
host agent follows it; the CLI does not claim to turn every instruction into a
runtime invariant.

The canonical pack lives under `plugins/relay10/skills`. `.agents/skills` and
`.claude/skills` are relative symlinks to that directory so a cloned repository
exposes the same skills to Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build surfaces that
scan those roots. The plugin manifests are at
`plugins/relay10/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and
`plugins/relay10/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and the repository root
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` makes this repository installable as a Claude
Code marketplace; all three pass their local validators but have not been
published to a curated marketplace. To install the pack in Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add minwoo19930301/relay10
/plugin install relay10@relay10
```

Installed Claude Code plugin skills appear namespaced as `relay10:<skill-name>`;
a session opened inside a clone of this repository loads the same skills through
`.claude/skills` or `.agents/skills` without installing anything. Grok Build
discovers the pack via `.agents/skills` (and optional Claude-compat skill
paths). Skills guide the host agent on Claude Code, Grok Build, or Codex.
Optional `dpr run` / `disciplinedrun run` model stages still use Codex CLI in
0.2.
The pack follows progressive disclosure and contains original clean-room text.
The Skill-ecosystem
source subset and license cautions are recorded in
`plugins/relay10/provenance/sources.json`; the complete agent, harness,
workflow, and Skill lineage is recorded in `docs/prior-art.md`.

## Default pipeline

| Stage | Capability label | Effort | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| scout | economy | low | read-only + optional search | inspect sources and collect context |
| architect/advisor | frontier | max | read-only | after scout, advise balanced/frontier work or economy work with unresolved questions |
| maker | balanced | medium | workspace-write | implement the plan |
| verification | no model | n/a | explicit argv commands | record opt-in command results |
| reviewer | frontier | high | read-only | review correctness and risk |
| explainer | balanced | low | read-only | write a newcomer-facing summary |
| Reader-10 | rules or configured model | low | read-only | check report structure or model-reported clarity |

These are role defaults, not a claim that one role always receives the
objectively best or cheapest model. The available catalog metadata and local
overrides determine the concrete model and supported effort.

The default `conditional` policy skips the architect call only when the initial
task is economy-tier and `scout.json` contains no open questions. The run still
keeps `architect.md` as a deterministic skip record, so the six-stage artifact
contract remains stable. Balanced/frontier work keeps the advisor, and an
economy run with unresolved questions stops before mutation if its invocation
budget has no advisor headroom.

## Commands

```text
dpr init [--force]
dpr doctor
dpr route <task> [--json]
dpr run <task> [--dry-run] [--live-readers] [--budget-calls N]
dpr inspect [run-id] [--json]
dpr report [run-id] [--output file]
dpr replay [run-id] --frozen [--output file]
```

Full binary: `disciplinedrun`. Same commands work as `dpr`, `r10`, or `relay10`.

The inherited v0.1 `replay --frozen` contract verifies the recorded hashes and
either reports the saved `report.html` path or copies that exact file outside
the run directory. `report` is the separate model-free re-render command and
writes a new file. A frozen replay is not a full environment snapshot, resume
facility, or proof that remote model behavior can be reproduced. Short alias `dpr` and legacy `r10` /
`relay10` accept the same commands.

## Configuration

`disciplinedrun init` writes the compatibility filename
`relay10.config.json`. Model roles are derived from
`codex debug models`; explicit model overrides take precedence. See the
[example configuration](https://github.com/minwoo19930301/relay10/blob/main/examples/relay10.config.json)
and [configuration schema](https://github.com/minwoo19930301/relay10/blob/main/schema/config.schema.json).

Verification commands are intentionally opt-in because project commands can
have side effects. They use an executable plus literal argv array, not a shell
command string:

```json
{
  "verification": {
    "commands": [
      { "command": "npm", "args": ["test"] },
      { "command": "npm", "args": ["run", "build"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

The default configuration runs no verification command. Configure commands
that are appropriate and safe for the current repository.

Advisor routing can be switched for comparison or compatibility:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "advisorMode": "conditional"
  }
}
```

`conditional` is the default, `always` restores always-on architect invocation,
and `never` disables the architect checkpoint. DisciplinedRun
records invocation counts but does not currently observe provider tokens or
billed currency, so these modes must not be described as a measured percentage
cost saving without an external evaluation.

Live Reader-10 can use the discovered economy-labelled model or supplied model
slugs:

```json
{
  "readerGate": {
    "mode": "live",
    "models": ["small-model-a", "small-model-b"],
    "minPass": 9,
    "maxRounds": 2,
    "concurrency": 3
  }
}
```

## Version 0.2 preview limits

- The verified stage runtime is Codex CLI. Direct OpenAI, xAI/Grok,
  Anthropic/Claude, and Gemini API adapters are not included, and providers
  cannot be mixed by stage. Grok Build skill-host loading is separate from
  xAI stage execution and does not change this limit.
- There is no MCP server, Apps SDK UI, or standalone GUI. Skill/Plugin surfaces
  cover Codex and Claude Code; Grok discovers skills via `.agents/skills`.
  CLI stage runtime remains Codex-backed in 0.2.
- The scout is a general read/search Codex stage, not a dedicated crawler,
  browser automation system, or site-specific extraction engine.
- Deterministic Reader-10 checks structure, length, terminology, links, and
  accessibility signals. It does not semantically understand the report.
- Live Reader-10 uses ten model invocations per round. Model names do not imply
  independent errors, and live readers check clarity rather than truth.
- There is no resume/checkpoint engine, `/goal` DSL, long-running scheduler, or
  durable workflow database.
- The only evidence-time checkpoint is the architect decision after scout.
  There is no mid-maker pause/resume advisor loop or automatic escalation after
  a failed stage.
- Runtime model routing uses catalog descriptions, priority, supported efforts,
  overrides, and the scout's open-question count; it does not query live prices
  or benchmark model quality.
- Verification commands are explicit opt-in configuration. No project command
  is inferred or run by default.
- Saved artifacts support inspection and model-free report regeneration, but
  they are not a complete frozen ledger of the machine, tools, or model service.

## Contributing and feedback

Use the repository issue forms for reproducible bugs, bounded use cases, and
Skill proposals. Each proposal asks for observable acceptance evidence and
clean-room provenance so the core does not grow from feature count alone. See

for the development and review gates.

## License

DisciplinedRun (formerly Relay10) is MIT licensed and was implemented as a
clean-room wrapper with zero third-party npm runtime dependencies. No source
code from the compared harnesses is included.

The design selection is intentionally narrow. From the Korean projects it keeps
role-specific model tiers, plan/build/review separation, doctor and inspectable
evidence, an external wrapper boundary, and short onboarding. From global
projects it keeps on-demand skills, read-only plan roles, checkpoint and success
gates, architect/editor separation, stateless transcripts, provider/worker
ports, and independent review. It excludes swarms, nested completion loops,
always-on daemons, databases, vector memory, schedulers, native TUI/GUI stacks,
global injection, and telemetry from the core. DisciplinedRun's
risk/verifiability/reversibility router and Effort Governor, separation of
correctness from clarity, hash-bound frozen replay, and Reader-10 gate are its
own additions.
